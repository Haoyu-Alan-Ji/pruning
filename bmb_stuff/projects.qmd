# R-Julia interoperability for mixed models

Doug Bates, Phillip Alday, and others have written the [MixedModels.jl package](https://juliastats.org/MixedModels.jl/stable/) in Julia to fit mixed models. It is considerably faster than `lme4` or `glmmTMB`, in part because Julia is fast and in part because Doug Bates has improved the algorithms. There a variety of tools developed 

The ultimate goal is to be able to use `MixedModels.jl`, more or less seamlessly, from an R session.
