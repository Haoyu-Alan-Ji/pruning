  abstract = {Reproductive accessory glands are organs involved in reproduction that do not directly produce or release gametes but can play crucial roles in securing reproductive success. In fishes, the two leading hypotheses about why accessory glands evolved are 1) in response to sperm competition, or 2) to facilitate parental care activities. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of accessory glands and test these hypotheses by estimating quantitative differences in evolutionary rates. We found that accessory glands are present in 116 of the 607 sampled species of ray-finned fishes, representing 26/267 families. We estimated that accessory glands have arisen independently {\textasciitilde}20 times and that these glands were gained 5.8 times faster in lineages with male parental care, compared to those without male care, supporting the hypothesis that they evolved to facilitate care. In contrast, group spawning, used as a proxy for sperm competition risk, seemed to select against the evolution of accessory glands, as lineages exhibiting group spawning gained accessory glands 3.9 times slower than those with pair spawning (though this failed to reach statistical significance). This study provides new insights into the evolutionary history of accessory glands in fishes and highlights the importance of parental care in shaping reproductive anatomy.},

  abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have emerged as an important tool for understanding the evolution of characters that take on discrete states. Their flexibility and biological sensibility make them appealing for many phylogenetic comparative applications. Previously available packages placed unnecessary limits on the number of observed and hidden states that can be considered when estimating transition rates and inferring ancestral states on a phylogeny. To address these issues, we expanded the capabilities of the R package corHMM to handle n-state and n-character problems and provide users with a streamlined set of functions to create custom HMMs for any biological question of arbitrary complexity. We show that increasing the number of observed states increases the accuracy of ancestral state reconstruction. We also explore the conditions for when an HMM is most effective, finding that an HMM is an appropriate model when the degree of rate heterogeneity is moderate to high. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of these generalizations by reconstructing the phyllotaxy of the ancestral angiosperm flower. Partially contradicting previous results, we find the most likely state to be a whorled perianth, whorled androecium, whorled gynoecium. The difference between our analysis and previous studies was that our modelling explicitly allowed for the correlated evolution of several flower characters.},

  abstract = {I present a new statistical method for analysing the relationship between two discrete characters that are measured across a group of hierarchically evolved species or populations. The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the group is evidence for correlated evolutionary change in the two characters. The method takes into account information on the lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees, develops estimates of the rates of change of the discrete characters, and tests the hypothesis of correlated evolution without relying upon reconstructions of the ancestral character states. A likelihood ratio test statistic is used to discriminate between two models that are fitted to the data: one allowing only for independent evolution of the two characters, the other allowing for correlated evolution. Tests of specific directional hypotheses can also be made. The method is illustrated with an application to the Hominoidea.},
