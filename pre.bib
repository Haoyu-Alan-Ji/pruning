	abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have emerged as an important tool for understanding the evolution of characters that take on discrete states. Their flexibility and biological sensibility make them appealing for many phylogenetic comparative applications. Previously available packages placed unnecessary limits on the number of observed and hidden states that can be considered when estimating transition rates and inferring ancestral states on a phylogeny. To address these issues, we expanded the capabilities of the R package corHMM to handle n-state and n-character problems and provide users with a streamlined set of functions to create custom HMMs for any biological question of arbitrary complexity. We show that increasing the number of observed states increases the accuracy of ancestral state reconstruction. We also explore the conditions for when an HMM is most effective, finding that an HMM is an appropriate model when the degree of rate heterogeneity is moderate to high. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of these generalizations by reconstructing the phyllotaxy of the ancestral angiosperm flower. Partially contradicting previous results, we find the most likely state to be a whorled perianth, whorled androecium, whorled gynoecium. The difference between our analysis and previous studies was that our modelling explicitly allowed for the correlated evolution of several flower characters.},

	abstract = {TMB is an open source R package that enables quick implementation of complex nonlinear random effects (latent variable) models in a manner similar to the established AD Model Builder package (ADMB, http://admb-project.org/; Fournier et al. 2011). In addition, it offers easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects (≈ 106 ) and parameters (≈ 103 ). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

	abstract = {Generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVM) are popular tools for modeling multivariate, correlated responses. Such data are often encountered, for instance, in ecological studies, where presence-absences, counts, or biomass of interacting species are collected from a set of sites. Until very recently, the main challenge in fitting GLLVMs has been the lack of computationally efficient estimation methods. For likelihood based estimation, several closed form approximations for the marginal likelihood of GLLVMs have been proposed, but their efficient implementations have been lacking in the literature. To fill this gap, we show in this paper how to obtain computationally convenient estimation algorithms based on a combination of either the Laplace approximation method or variational approximation method, and automatic optimization techniques implemented in R software. An extensive set of simulation studies is used to assess the performances of different methods, from which it is shown that the variational approximation method used in conjunction with automatic optimization offers a powerful tool for estimation.},

In this paper, we introduce a new implementation of a reduced-rank approach to fit large dimensional multivariate random effects by writing them as a linear combination of \$d {\textless} q\$ latent variables. By adding reduced-rank functionality to the package glmmTMB, we enhance the mixed models available to include random effects of dimensions that were previously not possible. We apply the reduced-rank random effect to two examples, estimating a generalized latent variable model for multivariate abundance data and a random-slopes model.},
