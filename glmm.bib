  abstract = {Generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVMs) are a class of methods for analyzing multi-response data which has gained considerable popularity in recent years, e.g., in the analysis of multivariate abundance data in ecology. One of the main features of GLLVMs is their capacity to handle a variety of responses types, such as (overdispersed) counts, binomial and (semi-)continuous responses, and proportions data. On the other hand, the inclusion of unobserved latent variables poses a major computational challenge, as the resulting marginal likelihood function involves an intractable integral for non-normally distributed responses. This has spurred research into a number of approximation methods to overcome this integral, with a recent and particularly computationally scalable one being that of variational approximations (VA). However, research into the use of VA for GLLVMs has been hampered by the fact that fully closed-form variational lower bounds have only been obtained for certain combinations of response distributions and link functions. In this article, we propose an extended variational approximations (EVA) approach which widens the set of VA-applicable GLLVMs dramatically. EVA draws inspiration from the underlying idea behind the Laplace approximation: by replacing the complete-data likelihood function with its second order Taylor approximation about the mean of the variational distribution, we can obtain a fully closed-form approximation to the marginal likelihood of the GLLVM for any response type and link function. Through simulation studies and an application to a species community of testate amoebae, we demonstrate how EVA results in a ``universal'' approach to fitting GLLVMs, which remains competitive in terms of estimation and inferential performance relative to both standard VA (where any intractable integrals are either overcome through reparametrization or quadrature) and a Laplace approximation approach, while being computationally more scalable than both methods in practice.},

  abstract = {Generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVM) are popular tools for modeling multivariate, correlated responses. Such data are often encountered, for instance, in ecological studies, where presence-absences, counts, or biomass of interacting species are collected from a set of sites. Until very recently, the main challenge in fitting GLLVMs has been the lack of computationally efficient estimation methods. For likelihood based estimation, several closed form approximations for the marginal likelihood of GLLVMs have been proposed, but their efficient implementations have been lacking in the literature. To fill this gap, we show in this paper how to obtain computationally convenient estimation algorithms based on a combination of either the Laplace approximation method or variational approximation method, and automatic optimization techniques implemented in R software. An extensive set of simulation studies is used to assess the performances of different methods, from which it is shown that the variational approximation method used in conjunction with automatic optimization offers a powerful tool for estimation.},

  abstract = {There has been rapid development in tools for multivariate analysis based on fully specified statistical models or `joint models'. One approach attracting a lot of attention is generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVMs). However, software for fitting these models is typically slow and not practical for large datasets. The r package gllvm offers relatively fast methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables. These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained ordination, including functional traits in `fourth corner' models, and (if the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about environmental associations.},

  abstract = {In community ecology, unconstrained ordination can be used to indirectly explore drivers of community composition, while constrained ordination can be used to directly relate predictors to an ecological community. However, existing constrained ordination methods do not explicitly account for community composition that cannot be explained by the predictors, so that they have the potential to misrepresent community composition if not all predictors are available in the data.                                                     We propose and develop a set of new methods for ordination and joint species distribution modelling (JSDM) as part of the generalized linear latent variable model (GLLVM) framework, that incorporate predictors directly into an ordination. This includes a new ordination method that we refer to as concurrent ordination, as it simultaneously constructs unconstrained and constrained latent variables. Both unmeasured residual covariation and predictors are incorporated into the ordination by simultaneously imposing reduced rank structures on the residual covariance matrix and on fixed-effects.                                                     We evaluate the method with a simulation study, and show that the proposed developments outperform canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for Poisson and Bernoulli responses, and perform similar to redundancy analysis (RDA) for normally distributed responses, the two most popular methods for constrained ordination in community ecology. Two examples with real data further demonstrate the benefits of concurrent ordination, and the need to account for residual covariation in the analysis of multivariate data.                                                     This article contextualizes the role of constrained ordination in the GLLVM and JSDM frameworks, while developing a new ordination method that incorporates the best of unconstrained and constrained ordination, and which overcomes some of the deficiencies of existing classical ordination methods.},

Models are flexible and can be used for various purposes, including exploratory analysis, that is, ordination analysis, estimating patterns of residual correlation, multivariate inference about measured predictors, and prediction.

In this article, we discuss the basics of GLLVMs and review some options for model fitting. We focus on methods that are based on likelihood inference. The implementations available in R are compared via simulation studies and an example illustrates how GLLVMs can be applied as an exploratory tool in the analysis of data from community ecology.},

  abstract = {Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) have gained considerable traction among ecologists over the past decade, due to their capacity to answer a wide range of questions at both the species- and the community-level. The family of generalised linear latent variable models in particular has proven popular for building JSDMs, being able to handle many response types including presence-absence data, biomass, overdispersed and/or zero-inflated counts. We extend latent variable models to handle percent cover response variables, with vegetation, sessile invertebrate and macroalgal cover data representing the prime examples of such data arising in community ecology. Sparsity is a commonly encountered challenge with percent cover data. Responses are typically recorded as percentages covered per plot, though some species may be completely absent or present, that is, have 0\% or 100\% cover, respectively, rendering the use of beta distribution inadequate. We propose two JSDMs suitable for percent cover data, namely a hurdle beta model and an ordered beta model. We compare the two proposed approaches to a beta distribution for shifted responses, transformed presence-absence data and an ordinal model for percent cover classes. Results demonstrate the hurdle beta JSDM was generally the most accurate at retrieving the latent variables and predicting ecological percent cover data.},

In addition, it offers easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects ({$\approx$} 106 ) and parameters ({$\approx$} 103 ). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},
