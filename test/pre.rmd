# Preparation Instructions

- Be sure to change the author in the YAML to your name. Remember to keep it inside the quotes.

- There is less hand-holding in this assignment.
    - The packages that need to be loaded will no longer be provided in the setup code chunk. You are responsible for loading the appropriate packages for the assignment.
    - Questions on examining the data will no longer be provided. You are responsible for getting a sense of the data prior to completing the analyses. 
    
- **This assignment will be submitted as 2 documents:**
    1) **Slidy slides** - this will help prepare you for the final project.
    2) **Original R Markdown document** (so we can see your code; I don't believe there is a code download option for Slidy)
